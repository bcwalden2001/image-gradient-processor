These python programs load in a raster image file and convert it into either a X or Y-direction gradient.

Both programs load the same image, iterate over all pixels of that image, compute the greyscale gradients using neighboring pixel matrix math, store the gradients into a matrix representing the new image, and then display and save the processed results using OpenCV.
